Thanks to Steve Nielsen <Steve.Nielsen@infores.com> and Craig Riter
<criter@riter.com> for helping with getting this thing working on
Win32.

Thanks especially to Steve who provided a Makefile.PL that works on
Win32.

Olivier Dehon <dehon_olivier@jpmorgan.com> found and fixed several
bugs, including fixing the crude way I initially implemented net_read.

William Ward <wrw@bayview.com> is hard at work porting
nsapi_perl to IRIX.  Stay tuned.

Thanks also to Danny Sadinoff (dsadinof@olf.com).

In spite of their help, all blame for bugs should be directed at me
and not at my collabarators.

Lastly, a big thank you must go to Doug MacEachern <dougm@osf.org> for
creating mod_perl, from which the concept and much of the execution of
nsapi_perl was borrowed and without which none of nsapi_perl would
have been possible.

Any contributions you can make are welcome!
