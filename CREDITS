Thanks to Steve Nielsen <Steve.Nielsen@infores.com> and Craig Riter
<criter@riter.com> for helping with getting this thing working on
Win32.  Thanks especially to Steve who provided a Makefile.PL that
works on Win32 and found (and fixed) several other bugs for all
platforms.

Steve is currently working on making nsapi_perl's threading issues.

Olivier Dehon <dehon_olivier@jpmorgan.com> found and fixed several
bugs, including fixing the crude way I initially implemented net_read.

Thanks also to Danny Sadinoff (dsadinof@olf.com).

In spite of their help, all blame for bugs should be directed at me
and not at my collabarators.

Any contributions you can make are welcome!
