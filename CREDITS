Thanks to Steve Nielsen <Steve.Nielsen@infores.com> and Craig Riter
<criter@riter.com> for offering to help with the Win32 build process.
Steve has sent me a jumbo patch which should simplify this process
considerably; I have not yet has the chance to incorporate these
changes.

Thanks also to Olivier Dehon <dehon_olivier@jpmorgan.com> for finding
(and fixing several bugs).  Olivier is also working on improving the
(crude) way in which net_read() is currently implemented.

In spite of their help, all blame for bugs should be directed at me
and not at my collabarators.
