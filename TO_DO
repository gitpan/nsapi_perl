Volunteers are wanted to help address the following issues.  If you
can make a contribution, even if it's as simple as giving advice, send
an email to the nsapi_perl mailing list at nsapi_perl@samurai.com.

-The following modules would be very useful:
        -"Thread-hot" nsapi_perl.  Steve Nielsen is working on this as
        we speak.
        -Authentication via DBM
        -Authentication via DBI
        -Persistent database connections
        -Perl embedded in HTML documents
        -Server configuration in Perl

-Basically anything done by Apache/mod_perl I think could, in theory,
be done with nsapi_perl.  (Of course, mod_perl has the advantage of
being able to poke around under the hood of its server.)
