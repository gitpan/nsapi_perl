Volunteers are wanted to help address the following issues.  If you
can make a contribution, even if it's as simple as giving advice, send
me (Ben Sugars) an email to bsugars@canoe.ca.

Major Issues
------------

-The installation process needs to be improved.  In particular, there's no
reason why nsapi_perl can't be made to build "out-of-the-box" on Win32.

-I can only get extension modules to work if I recompile them adding '-lperl'
to the cc options.

-Threading.  Grrrr.  Netscape *used* to let you run their multithreaded
servers as multiprocess single-threaded servers if you wanted to.  The 3.x
line doesn't let you do this, AFAIK.  So, we need a thread-safe libperl.so.
I know this is being worked on, but in the meantime, does anyone know if the
libperl.so with 5.004 is OK to use?

Major Wishes
------------

-The following modules would be very useful:
        -CGI caching like Apache::Registry
        -Authentication via DBM
        -Authentication via DBI
        -Persistent database connections
        -Perl embedded in HTML documents

-Basically anything done by Apache/mod_perl I think could, in theory, be done
with nsapi_perl.  (Of course, mod_perl has the advantage of being able to
poke around under the hood of its server.)

Minor Issues or Wishes
----------------------

-Send STDERR messages to error log.  A first approach might be to allow
people to import a newly defined warn() from Netscape::Server that's a
wrapper around log_error().

-Create a $sn->print(@list) wrapper around $sn->net_write($message).

-Anything else that people find useful.
