This document lists a few of the more obvious bugs I have come
accross.  There are no doubt more bugs, but I have not yet had the
time to identify them all.  Please send bug reports to the nsapi_perl
mailing list at nsapi_perl@samurai.com.

Bugs in Netscape::Server and related modules 
--------------------------------------------
-When using rq->vars to iterate over the hash, eg "keys %{rq->vars}",
you get an infinite loop.

Bugs related to CGI.pm/Registry.pm
----------------------------------
-CGI programs can't muck with @INC
-CGI::Carp qw/fatalsToBrowser/ does not work yet
